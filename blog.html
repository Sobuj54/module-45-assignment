        find() ?

          >Ans: The difference between map() and forEach()</span
        >:<br />
        <span class="font-medium">map()</span>: <br />
        i. The map() method is used to transform the elements of an array.
        <br />
        ii. The map() method can be used with other array methods, such as the
        filter() method. <br />
        iii. The map() method returns a new array with the transformed elements.
        <br />
        <span class="font-medium">forEach():</span> <br />
        i. The forEach() method is used to loop through the elements of an
        array. <br />
        ii. The forEach() method cannot be used with other array methods. <br />
        iii. The forEach() method returns undefined value. <br />
        The difference between filter() and find(): <br />
        <span class="font-medium">filter():</span> <br />
        i. The filter() method is used to filter all the elements. <br />
        ii. The filter() method returns the element that matches and removes the
        element that does not match. <br />
        iii. The filter() method searches through all the elements. <br />
        iv. The filter() method does not change the original array. <br />
        v. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
        <br />
        vi. In filter() method a value is passed to the function as this value.
        <br />
        <span class="font-medium">find():</span> <br />
        i. The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the
        selected element. <br />
        ii. The find() method finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing
        through the root to the leaf. <br />
        iii. The find() method searches through all the child elements only.
        <br />
        iv. It does not execute the function for empty elements. v. It does not
        change the original array. <br />
        vi. This method returns undefined if no elements are found.

        2. What is the difference between Local Storage and Session Storage and
        Cookies ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="font-medium"
          >Ans: <br />
          Local Storage:</span
        >
        <br />
        The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. As it is not
        session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. The client
        can only read local storage.There is no transfer of data to the
        server.There are fewer old browsers that support it<br />
        Local storage has 4 methods: <br />
        i. localStorage.getItem(key) <br />
        ii. localStorage.removeItem(key) <br />
        iii. localStorage.clear() <br />
        iv. localStorage.setItem(key, value) <br />
        <span class="font-medium">Session Storage:</span> <br />
        The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. It’s session-based and
        works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the
        duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed. The
        client can only read local storage. There is no transfer of data to the
        server. There are fewer old browsers that support it <br />
        Session Storage has 4 methods: <br />
        i. sessionStorage.setItem(key, value) <br />
        ii. sessionStorage.getItem(key) <br />
        iii. sessionStorage.removeItem(key) <br />
        iv. sessionStorage.clear() <br />
        <span class="font-medium">Cookies:</span> <br />
        The storage capacity of Cookies is 4KB. Cookies expire based on the
        setting and working per tab and window. Both clients and servers can
        read and write the cookies. Data transfer to the server is exist. It is
        supported by all the browser including older browser.

        3. What is eventLoop ? How does eventLoop work ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
        programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a
        few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
        <br />
        There are some types of event loop: <br />
        i. setTimeout() <br />
        ii. setTimeout() <br />
        iii. push() <br />
        iv. pop() <br />

        4. How does quizTimer function and chooseQuiz function work ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >Ans: <br />
          quizTimer:</span
        >
        <br />
        For managing timer at first we set a timer variable with an arrow
        function. Then if the count is greater then 60 and if we divided count
        with 2 there will be no reminder and classList will be remove and add.
        Else classList remove and add. Then we get the timer id from html and
        convert time into minute. Then we set minute length if it's equal to 1
        then it will be sequentially passing and then divided by 60 to convert
        minute into second and if second length equal to 1 then it will be pass
        through serially. Then we declare a quizTime variable and an arrow
        function that if it's dismiss,the timer will return a clear interval.
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">chooseQuiz:</span> <br />
        Here chooseQuiz variable with an arrow function and 2 parameter. Then we
        declare a isExist variable with arrow function to get the quizData from
        id and find the answer. If the answer data exist it will serial 0. For
        quiz of answer, if isExist id id equal to quiz id then the answer splice
        with serial and give the answer and break. Else answer push from
        quizData. Then declare a displayAnswer variable with answer parameter.
